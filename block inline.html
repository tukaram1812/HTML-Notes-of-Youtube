<!--    block and inline are two types of elements in HTML.
        block elements are those that take up the full width available, and start on a new line.
        inline elements only take up as much width as necessary, and do not start on a new line.
        block elements can contain inline elements, but not the other way around.
        examples of block elements: <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>
        examples of inline elements: <span>, <a>, <img>, <strong>, <em>, <br>, <code>
        examples of inline-block elements: <button>, <input>, <label>, <select>, <textarea>
